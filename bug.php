This code snippet demonstrates a common error in PHP related to unexpected behavior when dealing with type juggling and loose comparison.
```php
<?php
$a = '10';
$b = 10;

if ($a == $b) {
  echo '$a and $b are equal';
} else {
  echo '$a and $b are not equal';
}

if ($a === $b) {
  echo '\n$a and $b are identical';
} else {
  echo '\n$a and $b are not identical';
}
?>
```
The `==` operator performs loose comparison, while `===` performs strict comparison.  The loose comparison (`==`) will consider '10' and 10 equal because PHP attempts type juggling. However, the strict comparison (`===`) checks if both value and type are identical which will correctly identify them as different. This can lead to unexpected results if not handled properly.
